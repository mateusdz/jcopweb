        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          <b>
            The (Hellenic) National Cyber Security Authority (NCSA, hereafter
            the Authority) is the national competent authority for cybersecurity
            in Greece, according to the NIS Directive and national Law
            4577/2018.
          </b>
          The NCSA, which operates under the Ministry of Digital Governance,
          functions as a General Directorate covering the areas of cybersecurity
          strategic planning, prevention and protection, business continuity and
          coordination. The NCSA is recruited with public sector officials,
          including cybersecurity experts, IT engineers, legal experts and
          public management officials. NCSA has established strong
          collaborations with the Governmental CERT, the National CSIRT, as well
          as other competent authorities. Furthermore, the Authority
          collaborates with EU agencies, other authorities and organisations,
          such as the NIS Cooperation Group, ENISA and the EU CERT Network, and
          participates in the relevant discussions and works. Finally, the NCSA
          also is engaged in international collaborations and Europeanfunded
          projects, like JCOP.
        </p>
        <ul>
          The Authority's high-level mission is described as follows:
          <li>Supervision of national cybersecurity policy.</li>
          <li>
            Supporting national efforts in incident handling & threat response.
          </li>
          <li>Coordination of national cybersecurity stakeholders.</li>

            JCOP is a European project driven by EU's Cybersecurity's strategy
            and guidelines, which aspires to facilitate shared situational
            awareness, preparedness and coordinated incident response with the
            cybersecurity structures and mechanisms established under the
            Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS
            Directive).

          <b>A summary of JCOP</b> regarding drivers, scope, and objectives is
          presented below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <b>Drivers:</b>
          <li>
            <b>EU's Cybersecurity Strategy</b><sup>1</sup> (adopted Dec. 2020)
            focuses on collective resilience against cyber threats
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>“Cyber Blueprint”</b><sup>2</sup> - European Commission
            Recommendation on Coordinated Response to Large Scale Cybersecurity
            Incidents and Crises
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>EU CyCLONe</b><sup>3</sup> - Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation
            Network
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <b>Scope:</b>
          <li>
            <b>
              Design, develop and deliver a Joint Cybersecurity Operations
              Platform (JCOP)
            </b>
            tailored to the needs of EU Member State authorities entrusted with
            cybersecurity, providing a holistic cybersecurity operations
            solution.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <b>Aims:</b>
          <li>
            Create <b>a model Southeast Europe Coordinated Response Cluster</b>,
            encompassing authorities of Greece and Cyprus, with validation from
            the Norwegian competent authority.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Demonstrate</b> in practice the
            <b> capacity- and coordination- building impact </b> of JCOP at the
            <b>national</b> (between national JCOP instances) and the
            <b>EU level</b> (between JCOP instances and EU cybersecurity bodies,
            such as the CSIRTs network, CERT-EU, and ENISA).
          </li>
          <li>
            Establish JCOP as a
            <b>prototypical implementation of the “Cyber Blueprint”</b> and a
            reference that can be applied to additional Member States.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Given the vision and the goals of the National Cyber Security Strategy
          of Greece for the period 2020-2025 (Figure 1), it becomes apparent
          that a European project like JCOP is not only facilitating part of
          NCSA's mission as a means of collaboration with other European
          countries, academia and research centres, but it also supports various
          national strategic objectives. Thus, before even getting into further
          analysis, it is self-evident that the potential
          <b>
            added value of participating to European projects is directly linked
            with the mission and objectives of the Authority.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Moving forward to a more specific benefits estimation</b>, we will
          focus on the three pillars of JCOP's toolbox and the new equipment,
          which was part of JCOP implementation, and demonstrate how they relate
          to the Authority's mission and the national objectives.
        </p>
        <p><u>Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)</u><br /></p>
        <p>
          Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence (CTI) is an upcoming cybersecurity
          area of interest as an answer to a complex and evolving threat
          landscape and is inseparable from a National Authority's cybersecurity
          strategic planning and security awareness policies. JCOP project
          includes technical sessions regarding CTI sharing models (STIX &
          MISP), tracking of tactical, operational and strategic intelligence
          sources, both open source and proprietary, and finally implementation
          and training on a widespread CTI platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Alerting & Incident Response (AIR)</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          NIS cooperation groups, CyCLONe, ENISA and other international and
          European collaboration groups, rely heavily on information sharing and
          common approaches at incident response procedures.
          <b>
            Incident management optimization, through international/ European
            collaborations is a critical national strategic objective.
          </b>
          JCOP project in order to develop a proper Alert & Incident Response
          (AIR) toolbox, is analysing all the Standard Operating Procedures
          (SOPs) regarding National authorities AIR ecosystem and it is an
          opportunity to review and optimize relevant forms and communication
          lines.
        </p>
        <p><u>Cyber Security Operations training</u></p>
        <p>
          Cybersecurity Operations training is not just an internal issue but is
          also driven by the EU's Cybersecurity strategy and the Council's
          recommendations for achieving collective resilience against cyber
          threats (namely, the Coordinated Response to Large Scale Cybersecurity
          Incidents and Crises).
          <b>
            To achieve the EU's guidelines, capacity building and security
            awareness raising are elevated from local National Issues to global
            international/ European collaboration fields.
          </b>
          JCOP as a Joint Cooperation Platform, defines specific training
          scenarios and provides a useful collaborative training tool according
          to EU's directions.
        </p>
        <p><u>State-of-the-art equipment</u></p>
        <p>
          Part of the JCOP project is the addition of new technical
          infrastructure in National Authorities' premises to enhance their SOC
          capabilities. After consultation among the involved parties a new
          video wall control system with advanced management capabilities is
          added to the Authority's Infrastructures together with proper hosting
          equipment for the JCOP portal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The video wall control system is placed between the JCOP hosting and
          administration systems (Server & Workstations) and the video wall TV
          screens to provide the ability to manage incoming visual information
          from JCOP instances/ dashboards and distribute them to any preferred
          layout to the video wall.
        </p>
        <ul>
          With the suggested addition, JCOP infrastructure will be able to:
          <li>
            <b>fully integrate</b> with the existing monitoring infrastructure
            of the Authority,
          </li>
          <li>
            provide to the Authority access to
            <b>state-of-the-art equipment</b> for usage and further evaluation,
          </li>
          <li>
            ensure the addition of JCOP instances to current monitoring and
            evaluating activities, <b>from day-one of the deployment</b>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>
            Summarizing the added value of the JCOP project at the National
            Cyber Security Authority </b
          >, it
          <u>
            is clear that European projects can be a key element for National
            Authorities to achieve their mission and goals and they can actually
            improve the effectiveness of their daily cybersecurity operations.
