          The goal of the Action is to create a Joint Cybersecurity Operations Platform (JCOP) that is specifically designed to enhance the cyber capabilities of the EU Member State authorities, by providing assets regarding (i) Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), (ii) Incident Response and (iii) Cybersecurity Operations Training (COT). In addition, the Action's success will be determined by cross-border cooperation activities for cyber defense enhancement which is considered crucial for building trust among the Member States. Finally, the platform that will be delivered must encapsulate terms such as shared situational awareness, joint preparedness and coordinated incident response.

        <p>
          TUC is the project coordinator of JCOP and is responsible for the successful implementation of the Action, which translates into administration, monitoring, and quality assurance. More specifically, the activity that TUC leads refers to project management reporting, cost claim preparation, administrative checks, as well as providing a clear vision for the project’s goals and overall requirements. In close coordination with the European Commission (EC) and the European Health and Digital Executive Agency (HaDEA), TUC has to submit all required documentation, including financial statements. In detail, reports are submitted to HaDEA on a semi-annual frequency regarding the status of the progress of all activities. In case of deviations from the work plan, the coordinator has to take immediate action, in a responsible manner, to repel emerging problems and risks. Last but not least, TUC was also the organizer of the kick-off meeting that took place in August 2021 and four plenary meetings, in November 2021, January 2022, July 2022 (physical in Cyprus), and October 2022 (physical in Greece, Chania). The fifth plenary meeting is scheduled to take place in February 2023 in Athens, Greece.

          In addition to management, monitoring, quality assurance, and reporting, TUC is in charge of defining the Architecture of the platform, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and requirements of the Action. The architecture refers to the platform interfaces and functionalities of the core modules. Specific requirements and the architecture have already been defined, with the input of the authorities, who provided expertise to the requirements specification from an end-user perspective, and the contribution of the rest of the consortium for the specification of the requirements collection methodology, the technical requirements, the KPIs and the architecture itself.
        </p>
        <p>The overall methodology was defined following the steps below, in sequential order:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Identification of end user requirements</li>
          <li>Definition of logical (high-level) architecture</li>
          <li>Components specification</li>
          <li>Definition of detailed (development) architecture</li>
          <li>Definition of the full set of requirements</li>
          <li>Definition of KPIs and evaluation methodology</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          By the end of the Action, the goal is to provide a platform that is in line with the recommendations provided in the European Commission Recommendation on Coordinated Response to Large Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises<sup>1</sup> (also known as “Cyber Blueprint”), and the proposal for a Joint Cyber Unit, which demonstrates cross-border cooperation for enhancing joint cybersecurity operations, if the result is in line with relevant Security Operations Centers (SOCs) that operate around the EU Cybersecurity Strategy.

        <h3>Technical Contributions</h3>
        <p>
          On the technical side of the project, JCOP will offer a platform consisting of multiple cybersecurity-oriented components. TUC has directly provided contributions to the technical task of JCOP, and specifically: HoneyChart and GNORT. These tools are some of the locally deployed Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) assets of JCOP, and their main functionality is alerting/logging relevant information in the case of some type of intrusion to the host. Both of these types of software have been effective over the years and are deployed in order to protect information systems that can be vulnerable to intrusion attacks. In the case of JCOP, it is imperative that the platform utilizes such tools to proactively fend off attacks by parsing alerts/logs through the rest of the platform's components. In detail:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>HoneyChart<sup>2</sup>: a platform dedicated to creating and deploying honeypots utilizing HelmCharts and Kubernetes. Honeypots are a special type of software that lure and capture attackers. All traffic directed to a Honeypot service is considered malicious, since it should not exist in the first place. Honeypots usually take the form of websites, but they can also be files, e-mails and databases. Initially their goal was to detect worms, which blindly attack the whole address space, but since worm attacks have dissipated over the years, Honeypots are now used to detect worm-able attacks, like BlueKeep<sup>3</sup>, or provide useful insights for protecting Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and their supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) components. In the tool adopted by JCOP, a web interface for generating Helm Charts of containerized honeypots is presented (Figure 2). The front-end part was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the back-end with Node.js. HoneyChart provides a selection of low and high interaction honeypots, as well as the ability to create either custom honeypots or honeypots based on pre-built templates, exposing specific interfaces. The containerized images that are provided are the Dionaea, Conpot and Cowrie honeypots.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>GNORT: GPU accelerated Snort, which is an intrusion detection system (IDS). Snort<sup>4</sup> is an open-source tool that, based on configurations and rulesets, detects intrusions by packet inspection and payload analysis. Typically an IDS is set as a switch (Figure 4), between the host(s) and incoming packet traffic. Snort also provides a mode that can be set as an intrusion prevention system (IPS), which then directly controls the packet traffic, rather than simply making observations and alerts. It can be very easily configured by specifying certain rules that dictate ports or IP addresses, that the user wants to be alerted, certain string patterns that may appear in the payload section of a packet, and many more functionalities. Since it is an open-source tool, there are plenty of community-created rules available. More specifically, TUC provides the combination of Snort with a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) tool<sup>5</sup> (Figure 5), which implements a pattern-matching algorithm for string searching, that is executed using GPU resources for parallel and faster computation. The GPU porting of the matching algorithm is written in OpenCL language.</li>
