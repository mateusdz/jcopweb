          Since digital technologies become more pervasive in everyday lives and
          economies, cybersecurity incidents are getting frequent and
          diversified. Data breaches exposed 4.1 billion records in the first
          half of 2019<sup>1</sup>, while the recently-released ENISA Threat
          Landscape for 2020 states that “during the next decade, cybersecurity
          risks will become harder to assess and interpret due to the growing
          complexity of the threat landscape, adversarial ecosystem and
          expansion of the attack surface”<sup>2</sup>, reporting an increase in
          sophisticated and targeted ransomware exploits in the public sector,
          health care organisations and other industries, as well as the
          increased prevalence of hybrid threats, combing both the cyber and
          physical domains. The COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated the risk
          exposure, being identified by ENISA as a “prolific period for
          malicious actors conducting attacks targeting sensitive
          areas”<sup>3</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this context, threats in cyberspace endanger not only our
          democracies and freedoms but also the European long-term objectives,
          such as the Digital Single Market that aims to enhance Europe's
          position as a world leader in the digital economy. Both civilian and
          military European environments should be able to protect against cyber
          threats. Thanks to the NIS Directive (2016/1148), Member States are
          now forced to have a minimum baseline set of capabilities while
          providing cross-border coordination and cooperation. In fact, in the
          cybersecurity domain, 69% of companies confirm that compliance
          mandates driving spending<sup>4</sup>, while companies reportedly
          spent $9 billion on preparing for the GDPR<sup>5</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, regulatory drivers are not enough. Dealing with systemic
          and complex risks is highlighted as the top cybersecurity challenge by
          ENISA, since the increased motivation (often combining financial,
          nation state interests, nationalistic and political motives) and
          sophistication of threat actors (often state-sponsored) carrying out
          growing targeted and persistent attacks on high-value data, combined
          by the ever-increasing interconnectedness of various systems and
          networks, make “cyber risks harder to assess and mitigate”. In this
          regard, ENISA's policy conclusions and recommendations highlight the
          importance of using Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) as the main tool
          for cybersecurity preparedness and driving strategic and political
          decisions that will effectively tackle threats that threaten the
          well-being of the European Union. It is also emphasized that
          cooperation and coordination of EU-wide CTI activities are essential
          for informing and driving emergency decisions needed in crisis
          management<sup>6</sup>. Moreover, having access to a cyber-range and
          other structured training means are highlighted as essential enablers
          for building the skills of security teams by simulating attacks and
          testing multiple defence strategies.
        </p>

          The above are very much aligned with the recommendations provided in
          the European Commission Recommendation on Coordinated Response to
          Large Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises<sup>7</sup> (referred
          to henceforth as “Cyber Blueprint”), which aims to provide a
          structured approach towards shared situational awareness, preparedness
          and coordinated incident response that also considers and involves all
          key EU actors involved in response to cybersecurity crises (e.g.,
          ENISA, CSIRTs network, CERT-EU, Europol). Of particular interest in
          this regard is the newly launched Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation
          Network<sup>8</sup> (CyCLONe) that aims to contribute to the
          Blueprint's implementation and complements the existing EU
          cybersecurity structures by linking the cooperation at technical,
          operational and political/strategic levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Motivated by the above, the European Commission, under the Connecting
          Europe Facility 2014-2020 programme, launched the JCOP project
          (Agreement No.: INEA/CEF/ICT/A2020/2373266) in August 2021, aiming to
          <u
            >design, develop and deliver a
            <b>Joint Cybersecurity Operations Platform</b> tailored to the needs
            of EU Member State authorities entrusted with cybersecurity,
            encompassing a toolbox and methods facilitating
            <b
              >shared situational awareness, preparedness and coordinated
              incident response</b
            >
            in alignment with the NIS Directive-established EU cybersecurity
            structures and mechanisms.</u

          alt="Overview of the JCOP pillars and their interplay."
        />
        <p>
          To achieve its objective and provide a holistic Cybersecurity
          Operations solution, the platform will include:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Cyber Threat Intelligence (the “CTI” pillar);</li>
          <li>Alerting & Incident Response (the “AIR” pillar), and;</li>
          <li>
            Cybersecurity Operations Training capabilities (the “COT” pillar).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Figure 1 visualises the above three pillars of the JCOP concept, as
          well as the interplay between them. The latter, realised through tight
          interconnection & continuous feedback between each pillars'
          capabilities, will allow operators to fully exploit & maximise the
          efficacy of each capability, and eventually maximise the overall
          usability & impact of JCOP.
        </p>
        <p>
          The above will be deployed and validated through the creation of a
          model
          <b>Southeast Europe Coordinated Response Cluster</b> encompassing the
          national authorities of
          <b
            >Greece (Hellenic Ministry of Digital Governance - National Cyber
            Security Authority - NCSA)</b
          >
          and <b>Cyprus (Cypriot Digital Security Authority - DSA)</b>. This
          will not only demonstrate in practice the capacity- and coordination-
          building impact of JCOP at the national (between national JCOP
          instances) and the EU level (between JCOP instances and EU
          cybersecurity bodies, such as the CSIRTs network, CERT-EU, and ENISA),
          but will also help establish JCOP as a prototypical implementation of
          the European Commission Recommendation on Coordinated Response to
          Large Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises (referred to henceforth
          as “Cyber Blueprint”) and a reference that can be applied to
          additional Member States. The inclusion of an additional national
          authority in the consortium
          <b>(Norwegian National Security Authority - NSM)</b> will allow the
          accurate assessment of said applicability in other Member States.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the action, <b>JCOP</b> will be aligned with pertinent EU
          platforms and initiatives, such as the MeliCERTes<sup>9</sup>
          cybersecurity platform, the EU ISACs project for information sharing
          between CIs<sup>10</sup>, and the four pilots of the EU Cybersecurity
          Competence Network<sup>11</sup>. Further, in order to ensure that
          JCOP's activities will be in line with the EU cybersecurity strategy
          as a whole, the action will closely follow and adopt, tools and
          blueprints delivered by NIS Cooperation Group<sup>12</sup>,
          ENISA<sup>13</sup>, EU ISACs<sup>14</sup>, ECSO<sup>15</sup>,
          exploiting the outcomes of JRC<sup>16</sup> (such as the cyberthreat
          taxonomy<sup>17</sup>).
