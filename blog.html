              In this blog post, we describe how we have extended version 9 of MITRE ATT&CK Groups, as represented in STIX 2.1, to make available and queryable additional types of contextual information. Such information includes adversaries' motivations, the countries they have originated from, and the sectors and countries they have targeted. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use the new types of contextual information introduced in the enhanced STIX 2.1 representation of the Groups knowledge base to filter adversaries of interest.

              The Hellenic National Cyber Security Authority (NCSA) is the
              national competent authority for cybersecurity in Greece,
              according to the EU Network and Information Security Directive
              (NIS Directive - 2016/1148) and National Law 4577/2018.

              JCOP will help the National Cybersecurity Authorities to achieve their
              mission and goals, enriching capabilities and improving the
              effectiveness and efficiency of their daily cybersecurity

            <i>
              Since digital technologies become more pervasive in everyday lives
              and economies, cybersecurity incidents are getting frequent and
              diversified. Data breaches exposed 4.1 billion records in the
              first half of 2019, while the recently-released ENISA Threat
              Landscape for 2020 reports an increase in sophisticated and
              targeted ransomware exploits in the public sector, health care
              organisations and other industries, as well as the increased
              prevalence of hybrid threats, combing both the cyber and physical
              domains.
              <br />
              In this regard, ENISA's policy conclusions and recommendations
              highlight the importance of using Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)
              as the main tool for cybersecurity preparedness and driving
              strategic and political decisions that will effectively tackle
              threats that threaten the well-being of the European Union. It is
              also emphasized that cooperation and coordination of EU-wide CTI
              activities are essential for informing and driving emergency
              decisions needed in crisis management...
